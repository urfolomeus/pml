# Programming Machine Learning

This repo contains the code etc that I wrote whilst going through the [Programming Machine Learning](https://pragprog.com/titles/pplearn/programming-machine-learning/) book.

## Running the code

1. cd into the _pizza_ folder
1. create a local virtual env (if you don't already have one) `python -m venv .venv`
1. activate the virtual env `source .venv/bin/activate`
1. install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. run the file of your choice, i.e. `python linear_regression.py`
1. when done, deactivate virtualenv `deactivate`
